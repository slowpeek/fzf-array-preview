* About

This is a bash function to render arrays with =fzf='s preview
feature. You get keys to filter and corresponding values in the
preview pane.

The generic idea is taken from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/o9djvn/arrays_with_fzf/h3alju1][this]] reddit comment.

* Usage

Require the script in your code once. After that call
=fzf_array_preview= function with a var name as argument any time:

#+begin_src bash
  source fzf-array-preview.sh

  a=(1 2 3 4)                     # generic array
  fzf_array_preview a

  unset a[2]                      # make it sparse
  fzf_array_preview a

  declare -A b=([who]=pronoun [is]=verb [that]=determiner)
  fzf_array_preview b
#+end_src

Assoc arrays in bash has no defined key order. To make things clear
the keys are sorted before rendering.

Autocomplete array var names in an interactive shell:

#+begin_src bash
  complete -A arrayvar fzf_array_preview
#+end_src

* Demo

A demo script is provided as well to show rendering of generic, sparse
and assoc arrays.
